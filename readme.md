New tab page reimagined
=========

This is a new "new tab" page. It was created by Google, but in russian only.

I originally made this repository in order to get a far-reaching language support.

At the moment I am rewriting the whole extension. As the new tab page is a page I'll open a few hundred times daily, it shouldn't slow down the browser.
That is why the extension now comes without a background page and with very high performance.
