New "New Tab" Page
=========

This is the new "new tab" page. It was created by Google, but only in russian.

I originally made this repository in order to get a far-reaching language support. Now I also want to finish the work from Google and / or design it more comfortable.

Your language is missing?

Create a folder with the correct locale for your language in ```_locales``` and translate it! (https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/docs/i18n?hl=en#localeTable)
